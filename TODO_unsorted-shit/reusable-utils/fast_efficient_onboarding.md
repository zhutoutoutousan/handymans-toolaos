- Background
  - Daily Feed is a knowledge management tool for articles and web content. It allows users to create custom feeds of information based on keywords and concepts, as well as organize content into collections that can be shared and followed. The tool has many great use cases including upskilling, monitoring competitor activity, identifying trends in industries, tracking client news, and more.
  - After a year of development with two core developers, the team is growing fast and many functionalities are piling up. So the team asked leadership for more resources. Last week, Jack, a new full-stack developer, has joined the team. To onboard Jack to a fairly intermediate project as quickly as possible, Owen tried many approaches, some of them works, some of them not. Today, Owen is planning to write to the entire team about the retrospective on what works and what didn't

  - Hi Daily Feed gang, wish y'all a great weekend. I would like to share with you what I have learned about onboarding a new developer to a fairly intermediate project as quickly as possible. I have tried many approaches, some of them works, some of them not. This is a retrospective on what works and what didn't. I hope it will be helpful to you all.
- Working collaboration examples
  - Robin roll style meeting
    - We do have pair/triplet programming 2-3 times a week, each lasting about an hour, so we split an hour in sixes, for each chunk, we take turns to share the screen on real-time working process. It works well for new developers to get a sense of how the project is structured and how it is being built, while all of us have space to express our thoughts
